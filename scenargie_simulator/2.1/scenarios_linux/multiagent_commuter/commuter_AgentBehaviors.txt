# <Agent behavior definition format>
# BehaviorType:{Behavior name}
# [Time] Behavior
# [Time, Condition] Behavior
# ...
#
#   <Time format>
#   HH:MM or HH:MM:SS or seconds in double or "-".
#
#   Example:
#   [08:32] InitialLocation = Building1
#   [08:32:00] InitialLocation = Building1
#   [30720] InitialLocation = Building1
#   [-] InitialLocation = Building1
#     - "-" means the time when previous action/behavior completed.
#
#
#   <Condition format>
#   {status/profile in agent profile} =<> {value in double}
#
#   Example:
#   [120, Utility1 > 0.5] MoveToDestination = Building1
#     - On 120 seconds, only agents which have more than 0.5 for Utility1 move to Building1.
#
#
#   <Behavior format>
#   {event} = {value}, {event} = {value}, ...
#
#   Predefined event name and value:
#
#   InitialLocation = {initial location name}
#     - Agent will show up at a speciflied location.
#     - {initial location name} must be a name of building/park/POI, "RandomBuilding", "RandomPark",
#       "RandomPoi", "PresentLocation" or a user-defined location group name.
#     - RandomBuilding/RandomPark/RandomPoi is a randomly picked building/park/POI from all buildings/parks/POIs.
#     - PresentLocation means a current position of the agent.
#
#   InitialLocationId = {initial location ID}
#     - Agent will show up at a specified location.
#     - {initial location ID} must be an ID of building, park or POI.
#
#   MoveToDestination = {destination}
#     - Agent will move to a specified destination.
#     - {destination} must be a name of building/park/POI, "RandomBuilding", "RandomPark", "RandomPoi",
#       "InitialLocation" or a user-defined location group name.
#     - RandomBuilding/RandomPark/RandomPoi is a randomly picked Building/Park/POI from all buildings/parks/POIs.
#     - InitialLocation means agent initial position defined in "InitialLocation" or "InitialLocationId".
#
#   MoveToDestinationId = {destination ID}
#     - Agent will move to a specified destination.
#     - {destination ID} must be a name of building/park/POI.
#
#   DestinationChoiceType = "Random" or "Nearest"
#     - This is used when value of MoveToDestination is a user-defined location group.
#     - "Random" means a randomly picked destination from a user-defined location group.
#     - "Nearest" means a nearest destination of a user-defined location group from agent current location or
#       a location specified in DestinationChoiceBaseLocation.
#
#   DestinationChoiceBaseLocation = {base location to pick a destination}
#     - This is used when DestinationChoiceType = Nearest.
#     - {base location to pick a destination} must be "AgentLocation" or a name of building/park/POI.
#     - "AgentLocation" means a location nearest to agent location at this event execution will be picked
#       from a user-defined location group.
#     - When a name of building/park/POI is specified, a location nearest to the specified location
#       will be picked from a user-defined location group.
#
#   MobilityMeans = "Walk", "Bicycle", "PrivateCar",  "Taxi", "Bus", "Train".
#     - Agent will use the specified mobility means if available.
#
#   Wait = {duration of waiting time}
#     - Agent will stay at current location for specified duration.
#
#   WaitUntil = {waiting time}
#     - Agent will stay at current location until specified time.
#
#
# <user-defined Location group format>
# LocationGroup {location group name} = {comma-delimited location names}
# LocationIdGroup {location ID group name} = {comma-delimited location IDs}

# Example:
# LocationGroup Parkings = building1, building2, building3
# LocationIdGroup StructureIds = 102000001, 102000002, 102000003
